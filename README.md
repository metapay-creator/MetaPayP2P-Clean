# MetaPayP2P – Web3 Basic Income Simulation with Peer Transfers

🧭 *"Freedom through basic income — made sustainable via smart contracts and AI."*

A circulating basic income simulation with blockchain distribution, AI behavior monitoring, and real-time peer transfers.

---

## 🌍 Why This Matters

**MetaPayP2P** demonstrates a sustainable, self-circulating basic income model —  
one that doesn’t rely on unlimited government funding or taxation.  
By combining immutable blockchain distribution with non-intrusive AI monitoring, MetaPay enables digital economic freedom and scalable public benefit.

---

## 🧪 Simulation Structure

- **Total:** 15 rounds (10 distributions + 5 collection/redistributions)  
- **Time-compressed:** 2 minutes = 1 month  
- Every 2 minutes, the national wallet distributes 500 units to 10 users.  
- After 30 seconds, P2P transfers are allowed for 1 minute.  
- Then data is collected and the next round begins.  

🕒 **Full cycle ≈ 30 minutes**

---

## 📱 Test DApp Details

- A separate frontend is provided for each of the 10 test users.
- MetaMask must be connected to the **Sepolia testnet**.
- Sepolia test ETH is required to cover gas fees.

---

## 🤖 AI Analyze – OpenAI API Integration

This DApp integrates an experimental AI analysis module powered by OpenAI API.

🧩 It processes user behavior and transaction logs to identify economic patterns such as:

- Salary-like repetitive transfers
- Dormant users
- Hoarding or accumulation wallets

🖥️ Example Output:

⚠️ *Note: This feature is passive and never interferes with user autonomy. It only observes and summarizes.*

This is part of our larger goal: exploring **AI-assisted transparency** in digital basic income circulation — without control.

---

## 🧠 AI Philosophy

- Detects abnormal/dormant behavior  
- Suggests optimized logic (e.g., vendor payments)  
- Never enforces, only advises  
- In real-world pilots, AI may give soft recommendations (e.g., overuse of wages), **but autonomy remains 100% with the users**
